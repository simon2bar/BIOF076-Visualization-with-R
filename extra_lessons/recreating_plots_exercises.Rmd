## recreating dot plots
- Here's an example Dot plot

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/sc_dot_plot.jpg')
```

- We'll be using the same single cell RNA-seq data we used before - the PBMC data set '../src/pbmc_cell_expression.tsv.gz'
- You'll have to reshape this data into long format

```{r}

```
