## Before we get to Rmarkdown, what is markdown?

- markdown is mini-language designed for designing documents. It allows users to have the functionality of a word processor - different fonts, bullet points, tables, etc - but written completely in plain text 

- markdown has been used for years, but because of its steep learning curve many choose to avoid it 

## Rmarkdown

- Rmarkdown is a flavor of markdown repurposed by Rstudio. Rmarkdown was designed for programming notebooks, an environment where you can execute code *and* write in plain text. The R notebooks we've been using all use markdown.

- R notebooks can be "knit" into reports. These reports are highly customizeable with a huge number of output formats, including word documents and powerpoint presentations 
 - markdown can be used for blogs/websites, conference posters, and scientific publications  
 - making 

- the slides we have been using for class have all been made through R Markdown 

## Benefits of Rmarkdown

- document your code much easier, as its easier to write comments and longer explanations in plain text 
- create a report/presentation that is descriptive as well as dynamic; a new version of the report can be generated with out having to remake figures and move them around
- reproducibility: you know exactly what code you used to make a specific plot.
- Rmarkdown is probably one of the best and most useful features of the R programming language

## Anatomy of a (notebook) cell

- We've briefly covered how to use R notebooks, but we'll go into more detail now about how it all works 
![](src/cell.png)

- within the curly brackets for each cell, we set parameters on how the *output* should look like. In this case we set `echo=FALSE` which means we don't want the the code cell to be printed, and `eval=TRUE` mean, run this chunk of code. 
- These parameters only affect the cell in which they are set.

- to globally change settings for all chunks, you must have a chunk names `setup` as the first chunk of the notebook

## changing non-cell parameters 
- `knitr` is the R package the handles converting R Markdown into a formatted document. We can use functions from `knitr` to control a wide range of output 

- for example, changing the root(working directory)
```{r  eval=FALSE}
#```{r setup}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/Users/swamyvs/personal/')
#```

```

## RMarkdown in the context of plotting

- Rmarkdown is crucial for plotting;
- when making plots in RMarkdown, each cell defines the plotting environement for making a plot, in terms of the physical space a plot can take up (the units are in inches)

```{r, fig.height=1, fig.width=1}
#```{r, fig.height=1, fig.width=1}
#```
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 1')
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
#```
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  ggtitle('Plot 1')
```
