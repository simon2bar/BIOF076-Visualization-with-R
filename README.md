# 'BIOF 076: Visualization with R'

## Creating publication quality figures and interactive web apps with the R programming language

## Introduction
Creating compelling visualizations is an important aspect of biomedical research. The R programming language provides many libraries for creating beautiful figures and interactive web apps. As R is an open source project, it facilitates open science and reproducible research. R has been heavily used by bioinformaticians and data scientists for years, and has become increasingly easy to use. This course is designed to allow researchers to quickly dive into R and make visualizations for their own work. No previous experience in R is required. 

After this course you will be able to:

* Load and prepare data for plotting
* Generate common scientific plots like Bar graphs, scatter plots, and heat maps using multiple plotting libraries 
* Use git, GitHub and binder to share plots
* Use visualizations to explore new data
* Combine multiple plots to create publication quality figures 
* Design interactive web apps with R-Shiny 
* Integrate plots from R into posters and papers
* Complete a final project with your own data

## Format
The workshop is structured as a series of interactive lessons, with a lecture and exercises components. There 
Our engagement during this workshop will take several forms: 

* Class materials: All materials, including lecture slides and excercises will be availble on canvas, and the course Github repository
* All lessons will be held live over Zoom
* Communications: There will be a slack group created for the class.
 
## Software and Materials 
We will have a session to install all software before the course at XXX on October 2nd. Some of the main software we will be using:

* Software
  + R language base system -  the core interpreter for the R language that runs the code we will write
  + Rstudio - an integrated devleopment environment(IDE) that makes it signficantly easier to write code
  + GitHub - students will sign up for GitHub, an online repository for code. 
  + GDAL - software for using maps in R
* Materials
  + A computer, ideally with administrative access
  + Multiple screens(2 monitors, computer  +  tablet/phone etc)

## Schedule


## Office Hours
Office hours will be held at the end of each day from 3-4PM. 

## FAQ

Q. Do I need any Prior Experience in R
A. No, This class requires NO expreience in R. We will cover everything you need to know within the course.

Q. I don't have administrative access to my computer, how will I be able to install the necessary software?
A. While it's best to work on your own machine, a standalone cloud based environment will be available for people to use.
