## Learning how to use a new plotting package(or any package)

- We've spent a good chunk of time going leanring some libraries, but now I want show you how to learn to use a new package.
- This is an *very* useful skill, but one thats not formally taugth very often.
- Generally, people want to use a new package because they have some sort specific task/problem that can be solved by that package.

## Heatmaps 

- As a case study for learning a new package, we're going to go learn how to plot heat maps, which are difficult to produce with `ggplot`
-  Heatmaps are a common type of plot for clustering data.

- Heatmaps are used to show subpopulations within a set of data, both between observations and between variables. This happens by clustering both the row vectors, and the column vectors. 
- Heatmaps are extremely popular(if not seriously overused) in publications, because beyond being an informative figure, they can be aesthically cool to look at.

## `ComplexHeatmap`

- `ComplexHeatmap` is package for, you guessed it, making heatmaps, and is probably the most popular package for doing so. 
- its popularity comes from having a feature rich and well documented API

## Application Programming Interfaces( APIs)

- broadly an API is format and design of functions within a specific package.
- `ggplot` is an example of a well structued API - where we have functions that are sepearated into separate categories, like `geom` and `theme` etc, and within each categories functions have generally the same syntax. 
- Taking some time to read through a package's API and understand how it works can save you a LOT of time down the road. 

## Learning an API

- Work through the examples a package provides - and then start changing things to see what happens.
