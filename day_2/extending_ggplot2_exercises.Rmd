## revisting the line graph from earlier with `ggpubr`

![](src/reporter_assay_plot.png)
Remember this plot?
use `ggline` to remake the line graph we made a few exercises ago

```{r}

```

filter the data to the last time point, and make a boxplot with `ggboxplot`. Include a test for a statstically significant change in the data on the plot. 
```{r}

```


## gganimate
- Using the gapminder data frame remake a the bubble plot we made yesterday. This time we have data for multiple years

```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
anim_save('src/gapminder_bubble_animated.gif', p)
```

## plotting with maps 

Lets make a plot with some real data. We're gonna be working with some data about COVID-19 testing in maryland. 
'day_2/MD_COVID_cases_by_zip.tsv.gz' contains the per day number of positive covid cases by zip code for about 160 days in the state of maryland. 
'day_2/maryland_zipcode_to_county.tsv.gz' contains a mapping for maryland zip code to counties
'day_2/maryland_counties.shp' is a shapefile for counties in maryland

Were going to take this data and make this:

```{r}

```

As a starting point, this is the generaly workflow. Load data > join county level data to zip level data > aggreagte data to the county level  >  join map data > make animation 


- first add the county information to the covid data. check how many counties are shared between the covid data and the map data 
```{r}

```


- aggregate zip level covid data to county level
```{r}

```

- the character date to a DateTime vector
```{r}

```


- add the map data to the covid data. filter out the date '2020-05-21' and plot it 
```{r}

```
