## Where we left off
- we covered most of the useful parts of the tidyverse, but there are a few more topics to cover. 

## merging tabular data
- We've only been working with single data frames/tibbles, but we often will need to combine multiple data.frames together. 
- In its simplest form, this is called binding
## merging tabular data
```{r}
nrow(iris)
```

## merging tabular data
```{r}
rbind(iris, iris) %>% nrow
```

```{r}

```
 
## row binding(rbind)
- the simplest way to combi
```{r}

```


## merging tabular data
```{r}
nrow(iris)
```
- binds
- joins 
- case_when 
- across
