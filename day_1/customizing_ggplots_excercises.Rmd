## Practice with themes 

We're going to work with one of the plots we made earlier 


```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer, fill = class)) 

```


Assign descriptive axis labels and a plot title to the plot

```{r}

```


fix the labels similar to how it was done in the example

```{r}

```


change the y axis title so it is parallel to the x axis title 

```{r}

```

change the font of the title to AvantGarde, the color to red, and make it italizced

```{r}

```

now use guide to reposition the legend to the top of the plot 
```{r}

```


## practice with colors
- We'll be working with the `storms` data set in dplyr library(we havent covered this yet, but we will) for this part 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data("storms")
storms
```

make a violin plot for `pressure`, using `status` as the x variable. Give axes appropriate titles. 

```{r}

```

explore the palettes in the `pals` package. I've written a function to let you plot color palletes 

```{r}
library(pals)
source('../src/plot_pal.R')
plot_pal(pals::alphabet())
```


pick a palette and use the appriate `scale_..._discrete` function to color your plot based on the `status` column
```{r}

```

now pick colors from different palettes, and use them as part of a `scale_...manual`. 

```{r}

```

make a scatter plot of `wind` vs `pressure`, using the `category` to color the points using a contionus scale. make sure `category` is a continous variable

```{r}

```

## customizing multiple aesthetics 
- the `gapminder` dataset is a popular example dataset about the life expectancy, GDP and population for differnt countries across the world 
![](../src/gapminder_bubbleplot.png)

- this is a bubble plot. We're going to remake this plot with ggplot. the data we'll be plotting can be loaded by the function below. you'll need to use scale_size_? to adjust the point size; feel free to change the color scheme from something besides the default. You will also need to change the alpha value for the points 

```{r, fig.height=4}
data <- read_tsv('../src/gapminder_2007.tsv.gz')
```
