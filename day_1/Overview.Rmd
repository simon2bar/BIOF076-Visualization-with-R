## What is R and why is it good for making visualizations

- R is a programming language designed for statistics 
- Researchers who need to use statistics used R because it is free and open source unlike Stata or SPSS
- Researchers need to make plots and figures to put in publications, so they began developing plotting packages for R
- As biology is growing more and more computational across time, more biologists are using R for analysis and visualization


## Example Visualization 
<div class="columns-2">
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../src/fetal_retina_diff_exp-1.png', dpi=1000)
```



- this is an example of a figure made entirely in R. 
- At the end of this course you'll be able to make something like this
</div>
